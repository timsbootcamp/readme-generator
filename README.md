# readme-generator
Challenge 11 of edX Boot Camp (Front End) to build a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input.

> What was my motivation?

My motivation was to accelerate my front end skills in web development so I can successsfully secure a web development job.  I am building on my skills and each week I'm growing from strength to strength and want to achieve top grades throughout all the exercises.


>Why I built this project?

Building the website helped me to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical of applying
my Javascript, ES6 and Node.js knowledge that I learnt in Week 11.


> What problem did it solve?

It solved the problem of generating a README.md file based on a user's input.


> What did I learn?

I learnt how about features of ES6, installation of Node.js, using Inquirer and FS packages.


> What makes my project stand out? 

It stands out as I have successfully completed the exercise, used good programming practice in terms of writing clean code. I have used appropriate constants and variables that are understandable. There are comments throughout the code so it can be understood by any developer.  

I used Template Literals, arrow functions and made use of Destructuring. Also, I applied validation on mandatory
fields so user has to some data in order to continue.

I have pushed myself continually ensuring my work is of the highest quality. The code is readable and maintainable.
